Today, I found a recent activity on astronomy. In the beginning of this week, astronomers found a cloud of dust in the galaxy. This discovery led to scientists thinking about the “Missing Link” which is like how the universe started with stars forming light leading to the Big Bang Theory. I used [Huge Galaxy Found Lurking in Early Universe May be Missing](https://astronomynow.com/2019/10/23/huge-galaxy-found-lurking-in-early-universe-may-be-missing-link/) and [Cosmic Yeti Distant Universe](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/world/cosmic-yeti-distant-universe-scn/index.html) as my source.

Today, I found a recent activity about black holes. Scientists discovered two black holes, one of them were claimed to be 40 billion times the mass of the sun, while the other was found to be the smallest type of black hole. The smallest type of black hole is formed after stars die, collapse, and explode which even light cannot escape. The black hole that is 40 billion times the mass of the sun had a giant red star that orbits it but soon realized that the black hole was bigger than a neutron stars. I used [Scientists Discover Possible New Class of Little Black Holes](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-possible-new-class-of-little-black-holes) and [New Black Holes](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/world/new-black-holes-scn/index.html) as my source.
